# -Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Project
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction Project! In this hands-on project, you'll use a real-world dataset to apply data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to predict passenger survival from the infamous Titanic disaster.
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Build a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to determine whether a passenger survived, based on their attributes such as age, sex, class, fare, and more.
ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn
| Section                   | Topics Covered                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Load & Understand Data | Reading datasets, exploring features, identifying missing values |
| 2. Clean & Prepare Data   | Handling nulls, feature engineering, encoding categorical data   |
| 3. Visualize Data         | Analyzing survival trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib           |
| 4. Train Model (k-NN)     | Apply k-Nearest Neighbors classifier and tune `k`                |
| 5. Evaluate & Improve     | Accuracy, confusion matrix, trying other classifiers (optional)  |
